Description
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
The green dots are food.  The blue, magenta, and red dots are critters.
</li>
<li>
Each critter has a set of "X" genes and a set of "Y" genes.
These genes determine the probability that the critter will move in a given
direction at each time step.
"X" genes determine left-right movement and "Y" genes determine up-down.
At time zero, the first gene in a set is used; at time one, the second;
at time two, the third; and so on until the time resets back to zero.
Which gene set is used, "X" or "Y", at any time step is randomly determined.
</li>
<li>
The critters eat the food. When a critter eats enough food, it reproduces.
Its child is exactly like it except that there is a small chance that its
genetic movement pattern will be slightly different as a mutation might occur in
one of the genes.
</li>
<li>
The "Garden of Eden" is an area where the food is continuously replenished.
Critters that wander in there tend to spawn descendants which evolve into blue
"twirlies". Twirlies like to run in circles so that they can keep coming
back to the food in the Garden of Eden.
</li>
<li>
Critters outside of the Garden of Eden tend to evolve into red "cruisers".
Cruisers tend to more or less move in straight lines sucking up food and
clearing a path behind them. Since food is not automatically replenished in
areas outside the Garden of Eden, twirlies outside the Garden tend to die out
after they have eaten all the food in their area.
</li>
<li>
A blight will immediately destroy all of the food outside of the Garden of Eden.
Any twirlies in the Garden at the time of a blight are likely to survive but
cruisers will pass right through the Garden into the blighted areas with no food
and die.
</li>
<li>
Using the buttons below the display, try manipulating the food distribution so
that you can see the critters as a whole evolve from cruisers to twirlies and
back again.
You can also reset the simulation and change the simulation speed.
</li>
</ul>

<h1>
History
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
I wrote this program based on a similar program described in an issue of
Scientific American magazine from 1990 or earlier.
The first version I wrote was in Turbo Pascal sometime in 1989 or 1990 for a
biology class at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA).
</li>
<li>
The second version was in QBasic between 1993 and 1995 which served to keep me
entertained while I awaited results in a neurobiology lab at the California
Institute of Technology (Caltech).
</li>
<li>
I wrote the third version in 1996 as a Java applet.
I revised it sometime between 2002 and 2004 so that it could be deployed as part
of the
<a
  href="https://www.croftsoft.com/library/software/collection/"
  target="_blank">
CroftSoft Collection</a>.
In 2006, I fixed a bug in the code and the
<a

  target="_blank">
webpage documentation</a>.
</li>
<li>
In 2022, I converted the Java code to the Rust programming language.
Since Java applets are no longer supported in Web browsers, I compiled the Rust
code to WebAssembly (Wasm) to get it to run in a webpage.
See my

research page for links to tutorials that I wrote on how to do this.
